            <p> For the meningitis forecast I needed data from CDC annual reports on <mark>confirmed meningitis</mark> cases in the US.</p>
            <p> Data for several infectious disease are available on the CDC website in the ABCS reports; and for meningitis, reports have been published up through 2018.</p>
            <br>
            <iframe src="https://www.cdc.gov/abcs/reports-findings/surv-reports.html" title="CDC ABCS reports"></iframe>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p> These reports are avaliable as downloadable PDFs but the data are also displayed on the CDC webpage.</p>
            <p> Each annual report has a seperate web page where the contents live, but clicking to each page, scorlling to find the data, then manually entering it into excel...no thank you.</p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <p> Not to mention that this style of manual data scraping is highly prone to error and just <strong> way too tedious!!</strong></p>
            <p> So, why not use <mark>python</mark> to scrape it?</p>
            <p>Using a jupyter notebook, BeautifulSoup, numpy, and pandas, I was able to scrape, clean, and organize all of the data I needed.</p>

            <h3> Here's the code </h3>
            <p> I had to seperate out years into groups 08-12 and 13-18 as from 2013 onwards the incidence rate tables were changed slightly to inlcude additional age groupings. This meant that the starts I used the first time around didn't work for all years and needed to be adjusted.</p>
            <p> The 'starts' I used had to do with the fact that the CDC ABCS tables have no unique identifiers, such as an ID or class associated with them, so I had to pull all tables data then loop through from a specific position to get the age groups, table headings, and rates that I needed.</p>
